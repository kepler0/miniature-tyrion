    <h3>Brief on White Hat Hacking</h3>
    <p>
      White Hat Hackers do not wish to cause harm by their hacking. They use their ability to hack to find where holes exist in systems and inform people of those holes. They wish to make the world of computer science a safer place for all.

    <h3>This Situation</h3>
    <p>
      You've found a hole into a major computer organization's user database, it contains all of the information on their users in plain text. Being a White Hat Hacker, soon after finding this hole, you informed the organization of the hole you have found and how they might patch it, in hopes that they might secure their database and protect their users.
